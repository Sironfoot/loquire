loquire
=====

loquire lets you require modules using app root relative paths, e.g. ````local('/lib/utils')```` instead of ````require('../../../lib/utils')````. The latter is ugly, hard to maintain, hard to read, and will break when you try to re-organise your app's directory structure.

## Installation
	$ npm install loquire
## Usage

Add the following at or near the top of your Node app's entry point  (e.g. app.js)

````javascript
global.local = require('loquire')({ rootDir: __dirname });
````
This assumes your app.js entry point is in your apps root directory, otherwise you'll have to set the ````rootDir```` parameter accordingly.

To use in modules:

````javascript
// var utils = require('../../../lib/utils');
var utils = local('/lib/utils');
````

App root relative paths start with a forward slash (/lib/utils). If you omit the slash, it will assume it's in the same directory as the executing file, similar to using ````require('./utils')````. The following two lines are equivalent:

````javascript
var utils = require('./utils');
var utils = local('utils');
````

## Run Tests
